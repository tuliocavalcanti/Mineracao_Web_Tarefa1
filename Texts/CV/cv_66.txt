Abstract
We present a minimalistic but effective neural network
that computes dense facial correspondences in highly un-
constrained RGB images. Our network learns a per-
pixel flow and a matchability mask between 2D input pho-
tographs of a person and the projection of a textured 3D
face model. To train such a network, we generate a massive
dataset of synthetic faces with dense labels using renderings
of a morphable face model with variations in pose, expres-
sions, lighting, and occlusions. We found that a training
refinement using real photographs is required to drastically
improve the ability to handle real images. When combined
with a facial detection and 3D face fitting step, we show that
our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art face align-
ment methods in terms of accuracy and speed. By directly
estimating dense correspondences, we do not rely on the
full visibility of sparse facial landmarks and are not lim-
ited to the model space of regression-based approaches. We
also assess our method on video frames and demonstrate
successful per-frame processing under extreme pose vari-
ations, occlusions, and lighting conditions. Compared to
existing 3D facial tracking techniques, our fitting does not
rely on previous frames or frontal facial initialization and is
robust to imperfect face detections.
1. Introduction
By introducing 3D facial alignment techniques that can
process images in the wild, it is possible to improve the
performance of facial recognition methods [8, 44, 16, 24];
compelling 3D face models of a person can be generated
for gaming and virtual reality applications [7, 26, 37, 14,
50, 43]; and an accurate tracking model can be initial-

ized for real-time facial performance capture and anima-
tion [52, 12, 55, 49]. Most of the techniques rely on a robust
detection of sparse facial landmarks (eyes, nose, lips, etc.)
and tend to perform best when most features are visible,
front-facing, and free from occlusions or challenging light-
ing conditions. In many applications, such as video facial
analytics or driver attention monitoring, these assumptions
do not hold since the subjects are recorded in a fully uncon-
strained environment.
With the recent advancement of deep learning tech-
niques, highly robust regression methods have emerged that
can successfully fit a 3D face model for extremely difficult
cases, such as side views of a face or occlusions by hair.
State-of-the-art methods are based on regression [68, 31]
and directly regress the shape parameters of a 3D morphable
model (3DMM) [7] and expression coefficients [13] from
an image using cascaded network structures. While achiev-
ing impressive accuracies on several challenging bench-
mark datasets, they still tend to perform poorly in extreme
real-case scenarios, as demonstrated in this paper. Not only
is such approach limited to variations defined by the face
model space, but its performance relies on a perfectly tight
facial bounding box detection. Despite significant progress,
even the cutting edge face detectors [25] cannot guarantee a
clean face localization and cropping for extreme images.
Instead of a regression method, we propose an alternative
deep learning approach that estimates dense pixel-wise cor-
respondences between the input image and a 3DMM model
along with a matchability mask, which defines which pix-
els belong to the face and have valid correspondences. We
perform dense correspondence estimation by predicting a
per-pixel 2D flow vector between the input image and a
synthetic rendering of a 3DMM. Once the correspondences
are established, we fit a 3DMM to the input using avail-
able correspondences. Compared to sparse landmark detec-
tion techniques, dense correspondences provide more ro-
bust constraints, since any part of the face can be used for

matching, and our predicted matchability mask helps to dis-
tinguish non-visible parts of the face. Furthermore, our 2D
flow computation is less sensitive to clean bounding box
estimations during an initial face detection as oppose to ex-
isting regression approaches.
Inspired by the recent work of [66], we train a sim-
ple encoder-decoder network using synthetically generated
3DMMs with variations in pose, shape, appearance, and
lighting, and simulate occlusions using random box render-
ings. Since every face of the 3DMM have consistent mesh
topologies, the dense labels are automatically present. We
further refine the training using real photographs with cor-
responding face models obtained from the regression tech-
nique of [68], and predict the flow between the input image
and a statistical mean face. We show that by combining
our dense correspondence computation with a subsequent
face fitting step, we can perform comparably with the cur-
rent state-of-the-art face alignment techniques on difficult
images in terms of accuracy and are significantly faster on
public datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate highly effec-
tive pose estimations and 3D face fittings on extremely chal-
lenging images and videos.
2. Related Work
2D Face Alignment. Facial alignment for images and
videos has attracted a lot of attention from the research
community due to its wide range of applications. 2D fa-
cial alignment approaches aim to localize a set of fiducial
points in the face. Classical approaches include the Ac-
tive Appearance Models (AAM) [17, 42, 51, 56] and Con-
strained Local Models (CLM) [19, 52, 2]. Another com-
mon approach is to learn regression functions that map
hand-crafted image features to 2D landmark positions di-
rectly [57, 59, 15, 3, 46, 32, 36, 60, 67]. With the recent
success of deep learning methods, several approaches have
replaced the use of hand-crafted features with a convolu-
tional neural network [53, 64, 63, 45]. While such purely
2D methods have shown impressive results especially for
frontal and non-occluded faces, modeling of occlusions has
been mostly avoided. More recent approaches [11, 29, 21,
61, 49] have attacked this problem by introducing occlusion
variation in the training data. Handling large pose varia-
tions under difficult illumination conditions, however, still
remains challenging for 2D methods. To handle large pose
variations, several approaches have proposed to use multi-
ple shape models for different views [18, 70, 62]. However,
due to the requirement to test all these possible views, such
methods are computationally very expensive.
3D Face Alignment. In the context of 3D facial align-
ment, earlier works have focused on optimization based
methods that minimize the difference between the input im-
age and the model appearance [7, 47]. As in the case of
2D facial alignment, an alternative approach is to regress
the parameters of a 3D face model based on image fea-
tures around landmark points [12, 28, 30]. More recent
methods have focused on performing this regression with
neural networks, specifically with cascaded [68, 31, 40] or
very deep network structures [1, 35]. While such methods
achieve impressive results on challenging datasets, the main
drawback is being limited to the shape space represented by
the utilized 3D morphable model. We present an alterna-
tive approach of predicting dense correspondences between
the input image and the face model, which can potentially
be propagated to any 3D morphable model with little effort.
We provide extensive comparisons between our alternative
approach and the recent 3D facial alignment methods and
show that our method outperforms both in terms of accu-
racy and speed (see Section 4).
Dense Correspondence Estimation. The problem of
dense correspondence estimation has been mainly inves-
tigated in the form of optical flow estimation for track-
ing purposes [23, 6, 4, 10]. To compute dense corre-
spondences between different scenes and different instances
of an object category, energy minimization approaches
that match hand-crafted features with additional smooth-
ness priors have been proposed [5, 39, 33, 9]. Such ap-
proaches have been further improved by either jointly solv-
ing for co-segmentation [54] or analyzing collections of im-
ages [65]. Last but not least, recent methods have explored
the power of neural networks for predicting dense optical
flow [58, 20, 27] and correspondences [66]. These methods
have shown impressive results that motivate us to explore
the power of predicting dense flow to tackle the problem of
3D facial alignment. [22] has also explored using dense cor-
respondences for the purpose of 3D facial landmark align-
ment. We show that dense correspondences provide robust
constraints for 3D face fitting under large pose and illumi-
nation conditions since they enable any part of the face to
be utilized for matching.
3. Proposed Method
3.1. Overview
Our approach takes a source image and outputs per-pixel
correspondences between the source image and a 3D mor-
phable model (3DMM). Since correspondences are well-
defined only on regions of the face that are visible in the
source image, we also output a matchability mask that pre-
dicts the probability of each correspondence being valid or
not. We perform dense correspondence estimation by pre-
dicting a per-pixel 2D flow between the source image and a
synthetic rendering of the 3DMM depicting a frontal mean
face. Both 2D flow and the matchability are predicted by a
convolutional neural network (Section 3.3). Valid 2D corre-
spondences are easily translated to 2D-3D correspondences
since each pixel in the synthetic rendering is directly asso-
ciated with the 3DMM. Such 2D-3D correspondences are
then used to guide the alignment of the 3DMM to the source
image (Section 3.4).This pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Given an input image with a detected face, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture that predicts Dense Facial Correspon-
dences between the input image and a 3D morphable face model. These correspondences are estimated as 2D flow between the input
image and a synthetic rendering of a frontal, mean face. We also predict a matchability mask which indicates which correspondences are
valid or not. Using such correspondences, we can perform 3D face alignment even in very challenging cases of large pose and illumination
variation.
We next discuss each stage in more detail.
3.2. 3D Morphable Model
We use the 3D morphable model (3DMM) proposed by
Blanz and Vetter [7]. Each 3D face, S, is represented as:
S = S? +Aid?id +Aexp?exp, (1)
where S? is the mean 3D face,Aid andAexp are the basis for
the identity and the expression respectively. ?id and ?exp
denote the parameters for the identity and the expression
basis. Moreover, in order to project a 3D face S to a 2D
image we use perspective projection:
S2D = ?f (R(S? +Aid?id +Aexp?exp) + t), (2)
where ?f is the projection operator that depends on the fo-
cal length, f , and the principal point defined to be the center
of the image. R and t denote the rotation and the transla-
tion components of the pose. Thus, aligning the 3DMM
with an image is equivalent to finding the set of parame-
ters (f,R, t, ?id, ?exp) that minimizes an alignment error
as described in Section 3.4.
3.3. Dense Correspondence Prediction
Given a source image, Is, and a rendering of the 3DMM
showing a frontal, mean 3D face, which we call the target
image It, we propose a network architecture to predict a
per-pixel 2D flow from Is to It along with a matchability
mask. For each pixel location ps = (x, y) in Is, the 2D flow
Fs,t(x, y) = (?x,?y) maps ps to the location qt = (x +
?x, y + ?y) in It, predicting that ps and qt are semantic
correspondences. Since the 2D flow is well defined only
for parts of the face visible in Is and It, we also predict a
matchability score ms,t(ps) ? [0, 1], where ms,t(ps) = 1
if ps has a valid correspondence in It. We note that we first
perform face detection in the source image and predict the
flow on the cropped image based on the detection result. A
visualization of our network output can be seen in Figure 2
Figure 2. Sample visualizations of dense correspondences between
our input and our template image for two inputs. The first image is
the input. The second image is the matchability map that indicates
which pixels on the template are matchable. Note that we do not
explicitly segment out external occlusions and occluded areas are
also considered matchable as long as they reside in the face shape.
The two color maps on the right show the dense correspondence
between the two images. The holes found at the edges of the dense
correspondences in the third column indicate that the pixel cannot
be matched and does not have a flow to our frontal facing template.
Our network architecture for predicting the 2D flow and
the matchability generally follows the architecture recently
proposed by Zhou et al. [66]. Specifically, we use two en-
coder branches that take the source and target images as
input respectively. The output of these encoders are con-
catenated and provided as input to two decoder branches.
The flow decoder outputs a 2-channel feature map with the
same size as the source image, where the channels specify
the 2D flow (?x,?y) for each pixel. The matchability de-
coder, on the other hand, outputs a single channel feature
map with the same size as the source image representing
the probability of each pixel being matchable.
The encoders consist of 8 convolutional layers, each

followed by a ReLU layer. Every second convolution
layer has a stride of 2 in order to decrease the spatial
dimension by half. Each decoder begins with four triplets
of convolution layers. In each triplet, the third layer is a
deconvolutional layer with a stride of 2. The first and third
layer of each triplet is followed by an ReLU layer. For the
flow decoder, the triplets are followed by three additional
convolutional layers with an ReLU in between. For the
matchability decoder, the triplets are followed by a single
convolutional layer and a softmax function that classifies
each pixel as matchable or not matchable. Details of the
network architecture can be seen in Figure 3.
Loss function. Given a source and a target image Is and It,
for each pixel (x, y) in Is we denote by F(x, y) andm(x, y)
the 2D flow and matchability predictions and their ground
truths by F?(x, y) and m?(x, y) respectively. We train the
network to minimize the following loss L(Is, It):
L(Is, It) =
?
x,y
m?(x, y)||F(x, y)? F?(x, y)||2
+ ?
?
x,y
LC(m(x, y), m?(x, y)),
where LC denotes the cross-entropy loss and ? is a hyper-
parameter.
Training procedure In order to train the proposed network
architecture, we need access to images where ground truth
correspondences with a 3DMM are available. We use the
recently released large-pose 300W (300W-LP) dataset [68]
which provides the parameters of a 3DMM fitting each im-
age in the dataset. Given the pose and the 3DMM parame-
ters, we project the 3D face to the input image using Equa-
tion 2. For each pixel ps in the input image, we identify the
uv?coordinate of the 3DMM surface point that projects to
it. Then, we find the pixel qt in the rendering of the frontal,
mean face that has the most similar uv? coordinate. If the
distance between the uv?coordinates is less than a thresh-
old (0.015 in our experiments), we define a ground truth
correspondence between the pixel ps in the input image and
qt in the rendering of the frontal, mean template.
We observe that training the network from scratch di-
rectly by feeding ìin-the-wildî real face images does not
converge. We assume this is due to the large appearance
variations as well as the noisy ground-truth annotations. To
overcome this challenge, we propose to use a large scale
synthetic data in a pre-training process where we learn
dense correspondences between random pairs of synthetic
faces. Specifically, using the 3DMM we generate random
pairs of synthetic renderings showing faces with varying
identity, expression, pose, lighting, and occlusion (see Fig-
ure 4). Since both images in the pair are generated from the
3DMM, we have direct access to perfect ground truth cor-
respondences and matchability masks. Note that although
our framework is robust to external occlusions and able to
detect self-occlusions in our matchability mask, we do not
explicitly segment out external occlusions such as in [49]
due to limitations in our training data. During this pre-
training stage, since we provide both of the encoders with
synthetic renderings we share their weights. After conver-
gence, the network accurately estimates dense correspon-
dences between two synthetic faces, even with extreme pose
and lighting.
We next fine-tune our network on the 300W-LP dataset 1.
We fix the input to the target encoder branch to be the
frontal, mean face rendering while the input to the source
branch are the real face images. Thus, in this stage the two
encoder branches no longer share weights.
Although the input to one of the encoder branches is
fixed, we note that this input branch is essential to our
framework. If we only use a one-encoder-branch network
architecture during the pre-training stage, training with syn-
thetic data may adversely lead to overfitting to the appear-
ance of our synthetic images. To address this, we have two
input branches take an image pair to predict the flow to
guide the network to learn the correspondences instead of
memorizing the appearance. We then fine-tune the network
with real data while keeping one input fixed. In our ex-
periments, we observed that the training does not converge
1300W-LP also contains synthetic faces, but with more realistic texture
and background compared with our synthetic faces.
when discarding the constant branch since the task would
not align well to the pre-training setting. For this reason,
we keep a constant encoder branch in our final model.
3.4. 3DMM Alignment
Once our network is trained, during test time, given a sin-
gle input image we first predict dense correspondences and
the matchability mask with respect to the rendering of the
frontal, mean face template. We filter our correspondences
with low matchability scores and translate the remaining
correspondences to 2D-3D correspondences between the in-
put image and the 3DMM. We use such 2D-3D correspon-
dences to fit the 3DMM to the input image to further refine
our results.
Given a set of (pi, qi) correspondences where pi de-
notes a pixel in the input image and qi denotes its cor-
responding vertex in the 3DMM, we minimize the fol-
lowing energy function defined over the parameters X =
(f,R, t, ?id, ?exp):
E(X ) = Edata(X ) + Ereg(X ), (3)

where Edata measures the error between the projected

blendshapes [50] and we set wid = 2.5 ◊ 10?5, wexp =
1000. Sqi = (S? +Aid?id +Aexp?exp)qi denotes the posi-
tion of the vertex qi in the 3D face defined by the parameters
(?id, ?exp). wi defines the weight of each correspondence
and all weights are initialized to be equal. We iteratively
solve for the parameters listed in Eq. 3 to minimize the L2
distance between the mesh's projected vertices and their es-
timated pixel location based on the dense correspondence
at each iteration. This standard formulation is also used in
many previous papers such as [55], [49], and [12]. Once the
parameters of the 3DMM that aligns best with the input im-
age are computed, we recover any missing correspondence
and refine our predictions.
4. Experiments
4.1. Training Data
Our network operates on images of size 128 ◊ 128. We
train our network first on a large set of synthetic renderings
of a 3D morphable model. To generate these renderings, we
randomly sample different facial textures from the Chicago
face database [41], we sample the identity and expression
parameters as well as the rotation and translation from a
Gaussian distribution. We also randomly sample spheri-
cal harmonics values from a database of lighting environ-
ments and apply it to the face to generate a total of 200k
renderings on gray background. We also composite an ad-
ditional 200k renderings with random background images
downloaded from the COCO dataset [38](see Figure 4). We
use a total of 100k random pairs of source and target images
with gray background and 100k random pairs of source and
target images with real background for training. We use a
batch size of 12 and learning rate of 1e?4 for roughly 2
epochs. One epoch takes roughly 6 hours.
Once the network converges, we fine-tune it with the im-
ages from the 300W-LP dataset [68]. We also perturb im-
ages from the 300W-LP dataset with 2D image-plane scale,
translation, and rotation, and we also synthesize occlusions
by drawing rectangles similar to the method of [49]. An ex-
ample of the rectangles we synthesize to simulate occlusion
is seen in Figure 4 . We first train with a learning rate of
1e?4 for about two epochs and then drop the learning rate
by a factor of 10 and train for another epoch.
Figure 4. We train our network first on a large set of synthetic
data with variations in shape, expression, facial texture, and illu-
mination. We further composite some of these renderings with
real background images. We later synthesize occlusions onto real
background images as seen in the image on the far right.
4.2. Qualitative Evaluations
We evaluate the performance of our method both for
2D and 3D facial alignment on the recently released
AFLW2000 [68] dataset of challenging and large pose im-
ages and show qualitative results in Figure 5. We provide
comparisons with the recent methods that tackle the prob-
lem of face alignment under large pose variations [68, 31]
as well as state-of-the-art face trackers including Kazemi et
al. [32] and the TVS implementation of Saragih et al. [51].
Both of them have been widely deployed in the industry.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of combin-
ing our method with 2D face alignment method by initializ-
ing the face tracker with our predictions of 2D facial land-
marks. We observe that our method is more robust to heavy
occlusions, large variations in illumination, translation, and
image-axis rotation. Our method can also serve as a better
starting point for 2D face alignment method such as Saragih
et al. [51] to significantly improve its performance.
We also report evaluations on extremely challenging im-
ages and video sequences captured in the wild in the sup-
plemental materials.
4.3. Quantitative Evaluation
In addition to qualitative results, we perform quantitative
evaluations by measuring the accuracy of the 2D facial land-
marks. Once a 3D face model is aligned to an input image

our predictions.
using the estimated dense correspondences, we can iden-
tify the 2D facial landmarks from the annotated vertices on
the 3D model. We then measure the normalized mean error
(NMS) [68] between the ground truth and predicted facial
landmarks.
We evaluate our method on several challenging datasets
such as the 68 landmarks on AFLW2000 [68], 21 landmarks
on AFLW [34], and 21 landmarks on AFLW-PIFA [30] 2.
Since we did not have much training data with real images,
we included images from the 300W Challenge dataset [48]
and their synthesized side views in our training set, so we
did not evaluate our method on this dataset. We compare
our performance to state-of-the-art face alignment methods
including Zhu et al. [68] and Jourabloo et al. [31].
In Table 3, we report our results on the visible land-

achieved by Zhu et al. [68], which has been shown to out-
perform previous existing methods on this dataset.
In Table 1 we show our performance with NMS overall
of the ground truth 68 landmarks in AFLW2000. One is-
sue of this setting is that the exact locations of invisible and
contour landmarks is unclear [69] and subjective. More-
over, their 2D projections may vary with different fitting
and projection methods. Zhu et al. [69] propose ìlandmark
marchingî to address this problem. But still the definitions
of contour landmarks are arguable. In Figure 6, we observe
that a decent-quality fitting can have a high NMS due to the
subjective nature of the contour and invisible landmarks.
A strong motivation for detecting the contour and invisi-
ble landmarks is to help 3D face fitting. However, in our
method, we are able to get accurate 3D face fitting from
dense correspondences without relying on invisible land-
marks and the need of defining contour landmarks.
To better understand the performance of our method, we
exclude the contour and invisible landmarks and evaluate
the NMS over only the inner and visible landmarks. For
each face image, the ground-truth visibility of a landmark
can be obtained from its ground-truth 3D face provided in
the AFLW2000 dataset. We report our results in Table 2.
We observe that our method consistently achieves compara-
ble performance with the state-of-the-art for faces in small,
medium, and large pose.

Additional quantitative evaluations of our 3D model fit-
ting and dense correspondences can be found in the supple-
mental materials.
4.4. Runtime
In addition to comparably robust and accurate face align-
ment, our method is one to several orders of magnitude
more efficient compared with other state-of-the-art meth-
ods on large pose face alignment. Our method takes only
a single iteration at test time, providing us with a large ad-
vantage in terms of efficiency. In Table 5, we summarize the
runtime speed of the competing methods for large pose face
alignment. Without an iterative process, it takes only 9ms
on an NVIDIA Titan X GPU for our network to estimate
the dense correspondences, which is one to several orders
of faster than others. A 3D face-fitting post-process would
take up to an additional 10 ms on the CPU, meaning that in
total our pipeline can obtain a 3D face-fitting from an input
image within 19 ms.
4.5. Limitations
We see in Figures 7 to 9 the limits of what our network
can achieve. Namely, with respect to side faces and occlu-
sion, we are robust enough to obtain good results when one
key feature (i.e. face, mouth, nose) disappears, but perfor-
mance drop as more features disappear due to extreme pose
or occlusion.
5. Discussion
We have presented an alternative deep learning solu-
tion for 3D facial fitting to some top performing regression
based techniques [68, 31]. Our experiments show that it
is possible to reliably estimate dense 2D facial correspon-
dences from RGB images by training a convolutional neu-
ral network with encoder-decoder architecture using a com-
bination of real photographs and synthetic renderings with
3DMM variations, perturbations, and simulated occlusions
and lighting.
With the same amount of real-world training data we are
28.5% more accurate on inner visible landmarks than Zhu
et al. [68] for the AFLW2000 dataset and 14.8% less ac-
curate to Jourabloo et al. [31] for the PIFA dataset. Gen-
erally our results can be considered comparable as other
methods outperform us in certain cases (e.g their fitting
Figure 7. We observe a gradual decrease in performance for pose
estimation as the pose becomes more extreme and key features (i.e.
nose, eye, mouth) disappear. Our algorithm completely misses on
the fourth frame when the nose is completely occluded by the rest
of the face. The estimated yaw angle of the previous frame is 70∞.
Figure 8. Like with pose, we can handle the disappearance of one
key feature, and performance gradually deteriorates until our al-
gorithm completely misses when an eye, nose, and mouth are all
occluded in the fourth frame.
Figure 9. We see that for a frontal face, we handle intense lighting
conditions both from artificial and natural light quite well. How-
ever, when extreme lighting is combined with large head pose, we
see our performance suffers significantly.
among side views and wide-open mouths are slightly more
accurate) while we outperform related works in other cases
(e.g. we are more robust to external occlusion, illumina-
tion, and image-axis rotation). However, our approach is
significantly faster (refer to Table 5) and shows increased
robustness on our real test cases, such as for facial track-
ing in the wild, where the facial detection bounding box is
not reliable and does not always provide a tight crop (see
supplemental materials).
When assessing the sparse landmark positions after a
3DMM fitting step, our approach is less accurate than some
cutting-edge landmark detectors such as TVS (commercial
variant of [51]) or [32], but we can handle extreme con-
ditions such as large poses, challenging lighting, and oc-
clusions. In addition to the robustness, our method is one
to several orders faster than other state-of-the-art large pose
face alignment methods, and is the only one that can be
real-time. Our experiments suggest that a reasonable de-
sign choice is to use our efficient and robust dense 2D flow
prediction as initialization for a refined and more accurate
sparse landmark detection step.
Though more efficient, our current training is limited to
facial shape and appearance variations from 3DMM and
photos provided by Zhu et al. [68], which indicates a sim-
ilar performance to existing regression approaches. Never-
theless, since we predict 2D flows directly, we are not lim-
ited to the model space of 3DMM, and could potentially
increase the dimensionality of variations, and include more
expressions, facial hair, and potentially non-realistic faces
such as drawings and cartoon characters. Hence, the full ca-
pabilities of our dense correspondence approach is not fully
leveraged, but new training data sources need to be investi-
gated.
Future Work. While we improve the state-of-the art in
terms of efficiency and robustness, the presented framework
is far from perfect. For example, although our matchability
mask is able to accurately detect self-occlusion, we do not
explicitly segment out external occlusions from the face re-
gion of the image due to limitations in our training data. Our
accuracy is also limited by the low resolution (128x128) of
the DNN input, and we would like to improve the resolution
and accuracy to eliminate any need for a refinement step.
Additionally, although we improve state-of-the-art in terms
of robustness, there are still cases such as the ones listed in
the Section 4.5 where our method fails, and we would like
to extend out method to address these limitations.
We could improve our framework by introducing more
training data with accurate face segmentation ground-truth,
and better ground-truth fitting of the whole head, especially
the back of the head and ears, would allow us to accurately
track faces with even more extreme poses where close to all
the sparse landmarks that are traditionally tracked in other
methods are hidden. We will plan to explore new direc-
tions to generate more training data with dense facial la-
bels using both computer graphics and machine learning
techniques. Recent advancements in generative adversar-
ial networks are promising areas for exploration. We could
also extend the framework to directly infer 3D positions,
eliminating the need to do post-hoc 3D fitting. If we can
accurately infer dense correspondences for shapes beyond
the space spanned by 3DMM, we could also model faces
with more details and capture facial hair and impact general
3D reconstruction techniques such as structure from motion
and multi-view stereo.
