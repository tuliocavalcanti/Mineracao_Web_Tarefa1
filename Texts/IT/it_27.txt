Abstract
An important code of length n2 is obtained by taking centralizer of a square matrix over a finite field Fq.
Twisted centralizer codes, twisted by an element a ? Fq, are also similar type of codes but different in
nature. The main results were embedded on dimension and minimum distance. In this paper, we have
defined a new family of twisted centralizer codes namely generalized twisted centralizer (GTC) codes by
C(A,D) := {B ? Fn×nq |AB = BAD} twisted by a matrix D and investigated results on dimension and
minimum distance. Parity-check matrix and syndromes are also investigated. Length of the centralizer
codes is n2 by construction but in this paper, we have constructed centralizer codes of length (n2 ? i),
where i is a positive integer. In twisted centralizer codes, minimum distance can be at most n when the
field is binary whereas GTC codes can be constructed with minimum distance more than n.
Keywords: Centralizer codes, Bounds on codes, Automorphism groups, Puncture codes.

by Fn×nq .

Algebraic codes are important tools in data transmission. Ability of a good code is that, it detects
or corrects more errors of an encoded message when it is transmitted over a noisy channel. An error
correction capability of a code totally depends on its construction. A fundamental problem in error
correcting codes is to produce a code [n, k, d] with given n and k, find maximum possible minimum
distance d.
Centralizer codes are very special type linear codes of length n2. The concept of the centralizer
codes are beautifully constructed in [1]. For A ? Fn×nq , the centralizer code is defined by C(A) := {B ?
F
n×n
q |AB = BA}. The authors have computed bounds on dimension. They have given an efficient
encoding and decoding procedure. It has shown that centralizer codes can locate a single error by
looking at syndrome only. If A is a non cyclic matrix then centralizer code C(A) has dimension greater
than n. Non cyclic matrices are very rare according to [3] but the adjacency matrices of distance regular
graphs of diameter less than n? 1, are not cyclic. Thus authors relates automorphism group of graphs
with centralizer codes.
In 2017, this work is extended in [2], namely twisted centralizer codes, defined as C(A, a) := {B ?
F
n×n
q |AB = aBA} for a ? F. It is clear from the definition that centralizer codes are special kinds of
twisted centralizer codes for a = 1. It has been shown that dimensions of centralizer codes and twisted
centralizer codes are equal. They have refined bounds of dimension and minimum distance in centralizer
codes. These codes have less computational complexity to decode a received codeword through noisy
channel. They have ability to correct single error only and also assert that if a 6= 0, 1 then the minimal
distance can be greater than n whereas in centralizer codes (for a = 1) the minimal distance is at most
n.
In this paper, we define generalized twisted centralizer (GTC) codes obtained from A twisted by
a matrix D in Fn×nq by C(A,D) := {B ? F
n×n
q |AB = BAD}. It is clear that C(A,D) is a F-linear
subspace of the vector space Fn×nq . The centralizer codes defined in [1] are obtained from C(A,D) when
D = In, identity matrix of order n and twisted centralizer codes defined in [2] are obtained from C(A,D)
when D = aIn, scalar matrix of order n. C(A,D) is considered to be a code by constructing codewords
of length n2 from matrices B ? C(A,D) by writing column-by-column. We execute some salient results
of twisted centralizer codes. We give some idea on centralizer code of various length which is not of
the form n2 using the concept of puncture codes. Some examples are given which are the witness on
existence of generalized twisted centralizer codes. We show that for a matrix D ? Fn×n
2
minimum
distance of GTC codes can be larger than n.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give definition of GTC code and establish some
basic results on parity check matrix and dimension. In Section 3, we explain our main results. Section
4 discuss encoding and decoding procedure. In Section 5, we provide some examples on optimal GTC
2
codes. We provide GTC codes of length less than n2 in Section 6. In Section 7, we give conclusion with
an open problem.
2. Preliminaries
Definition 2.1. For any square matrix A ? Fn×nq and any matrix D ? F
n×n
q , the subspace C(A,D) :=
{B ? Fn×nq |AB = BAD} is called generalized twisted centralizer code of A twisted by the matrix D.
Proposition 2.1. Parity-check matrix for a GTC code C(A,D) is given by H = In?A?(D
t?In)(A
t?
In), where ? denotes the Kronecker product, A
t is the transpose of the matrix A, and In is the identity
matrix of order n.
Proof. If we take B = AD and C = O in Theorem 27.5.1 of [4], the theorem follows easily.
Theorem 2.1. Let, A,D ? Fn×nq and O be the null matrix of order n. Then the following are true:
a. A ? C(A,D) if and only if D = In or A
2 = O.
b. If D is invertible then B ? C(A,D) ? A ? C(B,D?1).
c. For A 6= O, we have In ? C(A,D) ? D = In.
Theorem 2.2. If O 6= A ? Fn×nq and D 6= In, then the dimension dim(C(A,D)) 6 n
2 ? 1.
Proof. It is clear from context of linear algebra that the dimension of C(A,D) is at most n2. Now, if
dim(C(A,D)) = n2, then every matrix B satisfies the relation AB = BAD. Bit, if we take B = In then
A = AD. Which is not possible for any D 6= In. Hence, dim(C(A,D)) ? n
2 ? 1.
Theorem 2.3. Let A,D ? Fn×n, and the GTC code C(A,D) contains an invertible matrix, then
dim(C(A,D)) = dim(C(A)).
Proof. Let B be an invertible matrix in C(A,D). Then, AB = BAD ? A = BADB?1. Now, consider
the linear mapping fB : C(A) ? C(A,D) such that fB(X) = XB. This mapping is closed since,
X ? C(A) ? AX = XA ? AXB = XAB ? A(XB) = (XB)AD (? AB = BAD) ? XB ? C(A,D).
Clearly, the mapping fB is injective and hence we can conclude that dim(C(A)) ? dim(C(A,D)).
Again, the mapping ?B : C(A,D) ? C(A) such that ?B(Y ) = Y B
?1 is closed since Y ? C(A,D) ?
AY = Y AD ? AY B?1 = Y ADB?1 ? AY B?1 = Y B?1BADB?1 ? AY B?1 = Y B?1A (? A =
BADB?1) ? Y B?1 ? C(A). The mapping ?B is also injective. So, dim(C(A)) ? dim(C(A,D)).
Combining both results we have dim(C(A,D)) = dim(C(A)).
Theorem 2.4. For all D ? Fq, the code C(A,D) contains the product code Ker(A) ? Ker(D
tAt).
If ker(A), Ker(DtAt) have respective parameters [n, k, d] and [n, k?, d?], then C(A,D) has parameters
[n2,K,D] with K ? kk? and D ? dd?.
3
Proof. Let, u ? Ker(A) and v ? Ker(DtAt). Then A(uvt) = (Au)vt = O and uvtAD = u(DtAtv) = O.
Which shows that B = uvt ? C(A,D) as AB = O = BAD. So, Ker(A)?Ker(DtAt) ? C(A,D).
The next part of the theorem will be established by a simple property of product code in [5].
3. Main Results
Let E,A ? Fn×nq . We define a set TE := {B ? F
n×n : AB = BAD = E}. According to our
definition, we have C(A,D) =
?
E?F
n×n
q
{B : AB = BAD = E} =
?
E?F
n×n
q
TE . Throughout this section we
denote rA as the rank of a matrix A.
Proposition 3.1. Dimension of TO is less than or equal to n
2 ? n · rA.
Proof. According to our notation TO := {B : AB = BAD = O}. Now, AB = O ? B ? Ker(A).
Now let KAD,O := {B : BAD = O}. Since BAD = O ? D
tAtBt = O ? Bt ? Ker(DtAt). We
take a mapping ? : KAD,O ? Ker(D
tAt) such that ?(B) = Bt. Clearly, this map is bijective. So,
|KAD,O| = |Ker(D
tAt)| ? dim(KAD,O) = dim(Ker(D
tAt)) ? dim(KAD,O) = n
2 ? n · rDtAt =
n2 ? n · rAD. Again dim(Ker(A)) = n
2 ? n · rA. Now, dim(TO) ? min{dim(Ker(A)), dim(kAD,O)} =
min{n2 ? n · rA, n
2 ? n · rAD} = n
2 ? n · rA.
Proposition 3.2. If TE is non-empty then |TE | = |TO|.
Proof. Let B ? TO and S1 ? TE for a fixed E 6= O and S ? F
n×n, then S1 +B ? TE . Which shows that
the |TE | ? |TO|. Let if possible |TE | > |TO|. Then there exists an element S2 6= S1 which is not of the
form S1 +B for B ? TO. Now, S1, S2 ? TE ? S2 ? S1 ? TO. But, S2 = S1 + (S2 ? S1) is in the form of
S1 +B, contradicts our assumption. Hence |TE | = |TO| is proved.
Theorem 3.1. Let A,D ? Fn×nq , then the GTC code C(A,D) has the dimension less than or equal to
n2 ? n · rA + n · rAD.
Proof. Let us consider TE := {B ? F
n×n
q : AB = BAD = E}. Basically the set TE is the common
solutions of AB = E and BAD = E. Now, AB = E is possible if columns of B ? Columnspace(A)
and BAD = E is possible if rows of B ? Rowspace(AD). So, B ? TE if B ? Columnspace(A) ?
Rowspace(AD). We denote, G = Columnspace(A) ? Rowspace(AD). C(A,D) =
?
E?G
{B : AB =
BAD = E} =
?
E?G
TE . By Proposition 3.2 if TE is non empty then, it has the same cardinality as TO.
Let us assume TE is solvable and non empty for each C ? G. Then,
C(A,D) =
?
E?G
TE ? |C(A,D)| ? |TO| · |G|
4
? dim(C(A,D)) ? dim(TO) + dim(G).
Now,
dim(G) = n · dim(Columnspace(A) ?Rowspace(AD))
? n ·min{dim(Columnspace(A)), dim(Rowspace(AD))}
= n ·min{rA, rAD} = n · rAD.
Using Proposition 3.1 we have dim(C(A,D)) ? n2 ? n · rA + n · rAD.
Corollary 3.1. If AD = O in Theorem 3.1 then dim(C(A,D)) ? n2 ? n · rA.
Let ? be a graph with vertices v1, v2, . . . , vn. The adjacency matrix of ? is a sqare matrix of order
n whose (i, j)-entry is 1 if the vertices vi and vj are adjacent, othewise the entry is 0. Automorphism
group of graph is the set of all automorphisms from the vertex set to itself of the graph ? which preserves
adjacency. It is denoted by Aut(?).
Theorem 3.2. If A ? Fn×nq is the adjacency matrix of graph ?1 and G1 = Aut(?1) and if AD ? F
n×n
is the adjacency matrix of graph ?2 and G2 = Aut(?2) then the direct product G1 ×G2 acts on the code
C(A,D) by coordinate permutations.
Proof. It is known by [6] that a permutation matrix P lies in Aut(?) if and only if AP?1 = P?1A. Let
(P,Q) ? G1 ×G2 and B ? C(A,D). Then we have, AB = BAD, P
?1A = AP?1, and QAD = ADQ.
So, AB = BAD ? P?1AB = P?1BAD ? P?1ABQ = P?1BADQ ? AP?1BQ = P?1BQAD ?
P?1BQ ? C(A,D). So,
? : (G1 ×G2)× C(A,D) ? C(A,D)
(P,Q) ×B 7? P?1BQ
is a group action. Hence the theorem is proved.
In twisted centralizer codes [2], it was shown that for a 6= 0, 1, minimum distance can be larger than
n. Here we show by few examples that GTC codes over binary fields have minimum distances greater
than n which is not possible to the twisted centralizer codes. Examples of optimal binary GTC codes
are given below whose minimum distances are larger than the order of A.
Example 3.1. Suppose A =
?
?
?
?
?
1 1 0
0 1 1
1 1 0
?

?
?
?
?
1 1 0
1 1 1
0 1 1
?
?
?
?
?
? F3×3
2
. Then an optimal binary
GTC code [9, 2, 6] is acquired.

Example 3.2. An optimal GTC code [9, 3, 4] is obtained for A =
?
?
?
?

0 1 0

.
In both examples, the order of A is 3. In first example we have minimum distance 6 and in second
it is 4.
4. Encoding-decoding procedure
Let the generalized centralizer code C(A,D) has the length n2 and dimension k. C(A,D) is a vector
space over Fq and it has a basis of dimension k. Let {B1, B2, . . . , Bk} is a basis of C(A,D). So, for an
information message (a1, a2, . . . , ak) ? F
k
q can be encoded as a1B1 + a2B2 + · · ·+ akBk.
The method of decoding is the reverse process of encoding. A receiver should know the basis
{B1, B2, . . . , Bk} to decode the received message into information message.
We have already established that C(A,D) is a linear subspace of Fn×nq and hence we can state that
C(A,D) is an additive subgroup of Fn×nq . Then, cosets of C(A,D) is in F
n×n
q . We can use A as a parity
check matrix since AB?BAD = O for every B ? C(A,D). To decode the information message, we can
use syndrome decoding.
Definition 4.1. Let C(A,D) be the non-empty generalized twisted centralizer code for a matrix A
twisted by the matrix D and let B ? C(A,D). The syndrome of B is defined as
SyA(B) = AB ?BAD.
Theorem 4.1. Consider two matrices B1, B2 ? F
n×n
q . Then SyA(B1) = SyA(B2) iff B1 and B2 are in
same coset of C(A,D).
Proof.
SyA(B1) = SyA(B2)
? AB1 ?B1AD = AB2 ?B2AD
? A(B1 ?B2) = (B1 ?B2)AD
? B1 ?B2 ? C(A,D).
Therefore, B1 and B2 are in same coset of C(A,D) iff B1 ? B2 ? C(A,D). Hence the theorem is
proved.
6
The motive of defining syndrome is that syndrome computation is more easier than the computation
by using n2 × n2 parity check matrix for authenticity. By using the parity-check matrix we need O(n4)
multiplicative complexity but usingA as a parity check matrix computation has O(nm) complexity where
m < 2.3729 by [7]. Also, the purpose of taking the code C(A,D) := {B ? Fn×nq |AB = BAD} instead
of C(A,D) := {B ? Fn×nq |AB = DBA)} is due to less computational complexity of the syndrome. The
process of syndrome decoding is very similar with usual decoding process.
5. Some optimal generalized twisted centralizer codes

6. Generalized centralizer codes of length less than n2
Generalized twisted centralizer codes of length less than n2 can be constructed by choosing B with
some entries are 0 in fixed positions. Clearly, that set is a subcode of C(A,D) say S(A,D). Puncturing
those fixed coordinates of the subcode S(A,D) we will get a new code of length n2 ? i where i is a
positive integer in 1 ? i < (n? 1)2.
Using this puncturing method, the multiplicative complexity is reduced as O((n ? i)m) where m <
2.3729.
This result works well when i is near to 1.

7. Conclusion
In this paper we have generalized the idea of twisted centralizer codes [2]. It has shown in Section
2 that dimension of twisted centralizer code is equal to GTC code. In Section 3, an upper bound on
8
dimension of GTC code has been derived. Encoding and decoding procedure has been implemented
to GTC codes. Length of centralizer codes could be shorten by using concept of puncture codes. In
twisted centralizer codes, minimum distance can be at most n when the field is binary whereas we have
constructed GTC code with minimum distance more than n when D ? Fn×n
2
. An error can be corrected
by simply looking at the syndrome. But finding t-errors (t > 1) in twisted centralizer codes or in GTC
codes is still open.
