Abstract
We present a novel single-shot text detector that directly
outputs word-level bounding boxes in a natural image. We
propose an attention mechanism which roughly identifies
text regions via an automatically learned attentional map.
This substantially suppresses background interference in
the convolutional features, which is the key to producing
accurate inference of words, particularly at extremely small
sizes. This results in a single model that essentially works
in a coarse-to-fine manner. It departs from recent FCN-
based text detectors which cascade multiple FCN models
to achieve an accurate prediction. Furthermore, we de-
velop a hierarchical inception module which efficiently ag-
gregates multi-scale inception features. This enhances local
details, and also encodes strong context information, allow-
ing the detector to work reliably on multi-scale and multi-
orientation text with single-scale images. Our text detector
achieves an F-measure of 77% on the ICDAR 2015 bench-
mark, advancing the state-of-the-art results in [18, 28].

1. Introduction
Reading text in the wild has attracted increasing atten-
tion in computer vision community, as shown in recent
work [28, 4, 36, 38, 2, 6]. It has numerous potential applica-
tions in image retrieval, industrial automation, robot naviga-
tion and scene understanding. Recent work focuses on text
detection in natural images, which remains a challenging
problem [28, 4, 36, 38, 2]. The main difficulty lies in a vast
diversity in text scale, orientation, illumination, and font,
which often come with a highly complicated background.
Previous works in text detection have been dominated by
bottom-up approaches [3, 9, 10, 33, 8], which often contain
Figure 1: Illustrations of text attention mechanism in the
proposed one-shot text detector. Our model automatically
learns a rough text regional attention which is used to high-
light text information in the convolutional features. This
makes it possible to achieve accurate word-level predictions
in one shot. Text can be precisely separated and accurately
predicted at the word level in challenging cases.
multiple sequential steps, including character or text com-
ponent detection, followed by character classification or fil-
tering, text line construction and word splitting. Character
detection and filtering steps play a key role in such bottom-
up approaches. Previous methods typically identify charac-
ter or text component candidates using connected compo-
nent based approaches (e.g., stroke width [3, 9] or extremal
region [22, 10, 33]), or sliding window methods [12, 30, 6].
However, both groups of methods commonly suffer from
two main limitations which significantly reduce their effi-
ciencies and performance. First, text detection is built on
identification of individual characters or components, mak-
ing it difficult to explore regional context information. This

often results in a low recall where ambiguous characters are
easily discarded. It also leads to a reduction in precision, by
generating a large number of false detections. Second, mul-
tiple sequential steps make the system highly complicated,
and errors are easily accumulated in the later steps.
Deep learning technologies have advanced the perfor-
mance of text detection considerably [28, 4, 36, 38, 7, 6].
A number of recent approaches [36, 4, 7, 32] were built
on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) [19], by produc-
ing pixel-wise prediction of text or non-text. We refer this
group of methods as pixel-based text detectors, which cast
previous character-based detections into the problem of text
semantic segmentation. This allows them to explore rich re-
gional context information, resulting in a stronger capability
for detecting ambiguous text, and also reducing the num-
ber of false detections substantially. In spite of effectively
identifying rough text regions, these FCN-based approaches
fail to produce accurate word-level predictions with a sin-
gle model. The main challenge is to precisely identify in-
dividual words from a detected rough region of text. As
indicated in [28], the task of text detection often requires a
higher localization accuracy than general object detection.
To improve the accuracy, a coast-to-fine detection pipeline
was developed, by cascading two FCN models [7, 36]. The
second FCN produces word- or character-level predictions
on a cropped text region detected by the first one. This in-
evitably increases system complexity: (i) it is highly heuris-
tic yet complicated to correctly crop out regions of texts,
words or characters from a predicted heatmap [7, 36]; (ii)
multiple bottom-up steps are still required for constructing
text lines/words [36, 32].
Recently, another group of text detectors was developed
for direct prediction of text bounding boxes, by extending
from the state-of-the-art object detectors, such as Faster R-
CNN [23] and SSD [17]. They all aim to predict text boxes
directly by sliding a window through the convolutional fea-
tures [18, 28, 16, 4, 37, 24], and we refer them as box-
based text detectors. The box-based text detectors are often
trained by simply using bounding-box annotations, which
may be too coarse (high-level) to provide a direct and de-
tailed supervision, compared to the pixel-based approaches
where a text mask is provided. This makes the models diffi-
cult to learn sufficient word information in details, leading
to accuracy loss in one-shot prediction of words, particu-
larly for those small-scale ones. Therefore, they may again
come up with multiple post-processing steps to improve the
performance.
1.1. Contributions
These related approaches inspire current work that aims
to directly estimate word-level bounding boxes in one shot.
We cast the cascaded FCNs detectors into a single model
by introducing a new attention module, which enables a di-
rect mask supervision that explicitly encodes detailed text
information in training, and functions on an implicit text
region detection in testing. This elegantly bridges the gap
between the pixel-based approaches and the box-based text
detectors, resulting in a single-shot model that essentially
works in a coarse-to-fine manner. We develop a hierarchical
inception module which further enhances the convolutional
features. The main contributions of the paper are three-fold.
First, we propose a novel text attention module by intro-
ducing a new auxiliary loss, built upon the aggregated in-
ception convolutional features. It explicitly encodes strong
text-specific information using a pixel-wise text mask, al-
lowing the model to learn rough top-down spatial atten-
tion on text regions. This text regional attention signifi-
cantly suppresses background interference in the convolu-
tional features, which turns out to reduce false detections
and also highlight challenging text patterns.
Second, we develop a hierarchical inception module
which efficiently aggregates multi-scale inception features.
An inception architecture with dilated convolutions [34] is
applied to each convolutional layer, enabling the model to
capture multi-scale image content. The multi-layer aggre-
gations further enhance local detailed information and en-
code rich context information, resulting in stronger deep
features for word prediction.
Third, the proposed text-specific modules are seamlessly
incorporated into the SSD framework, which elegantly cus-
tomizes it towards fast, accurate and single-short text detec-
tion. This results in a powerful text detector that works re-
liably on multi-scale and multi-orientation text with single-
scale inputs. It obtains state-of-the-art performance on the
standard ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2015 benchmarks, with
about 0.13s running time on an image of 704× 704.
2. Related Work
Previous works on scene text detection mainly focus on
bottom-up approaches, which detect characters or text com-
ponents from images by using hand-crafted features [27,
33, 10, 31] or sliding window methods [12, 30]. They of-
ten involve pixel-level binary classification of text/non-text
and generate a text salience map. Then multiple bottom-up
steps are designed to group text-related pixels into charac-
ters, which are further formed character pairs, and then text
lines. Each step may be followed by a text/non-text filter
or classifier. Most of these steps are built on the heuristic
or hand-crafted features, e.g., gradient, stroke width [3, 9],
covariance descriptor [9], etc. These bottom-up approaches
are complicated, and identification of individual characters
using low-level features is neither robust nor reliable.
Deep learning technologies have significantly advanced
the performance of text detection in the past years [28, 4,
36, 16, 7]. These approaches essentially work in a sliding
window fashion, with two key developments: (i) they lever-
Figure 2: Our single-shot text detector contains three main parts: a convolutional part, a text-specific part, and a word
box prediction part. We propose the text-specific part which comprises a Text Attention Module (TAM) and a Hierarchical
Inception Module (HIM). The TAM introduces a new pixel-wise supervision of text, allowing the model to automatically learn
text attention map which identifies rough text regions. The HIM aggregates multi-layer inception modules, and enhances the
convolutional features towards text task.
age deep features, jointly learned with a classifier, to en-
able strong representation of text; (ii) sharing convolutional
mechanism [19, 6] was applied for reducing the computa-
tional cost remarkably. With these two improvements, a
number of Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) [19] based
approaches have been proposed [36, 7, 32]. They compute
pixel-wise semantic estimations of text or non-text, result-
ing in a fast text detector able to explore rich regional con-
text information. However, these pixel-based text detectors
are difficult to provide sufficient localization accuracy by
using a single model. Furthermore, accurate segmentation
of text from a predicted heatmap is complicated, and often
requires a number of heuristic post-processing steps.
Our work also relates to most recent approaches [18, 28,
16, 4, 37, 24] which are extended from the state-of-the-art
object detectors, such as SSD [17] and Fast R-CNN [23].
These approaches all aim to predict text bounding boxes
from the convolutional features. Liao et. al. [16] pro-
posed a TextBox by extending the SSD model for text de-
tection, but their performance is limited by the SSD ar-
chitecture which is designed for general object detection.
Deep Matching Prior Network (DMPNet) was proposed
in [18], by introducing quadrilateral sliding windows to
handle multi-orientation text. Accurate text localization is
achieved by using multi-step coarse-to-fine detection with
post adjustments. Tian et. al. [28] proposed a Connection-
ist Text Proposal Network (CTPN) which detects a text line
by predicting a sequence of fine-scale text components. The
CTPN is difficult to work on multi-orientation text and re-
quires bottom-up steps to group text components into text
lines. Gupta et. al. [4] developed a Fully Convolutional
Regression Network (FCRN) which predicts word bound-
ing boxes in an image. However, the FCRN requires three-
stage post-processing steps which reduce the efficiency of
the system considerably. For example, the post-processing
steps take about 1.2s/image, comparing to 0.07s/image for
bounding box estimations. Our work differs distinctly from
these approaches by proposing two text-specific modules.
It has a number of appealing properties that advance over
these related methods: (i) it is a single-shot detector that di-
rectly outputs word bounding boxes, filling the gap between
semantic text segmentation and direct regression of word
boxes; (ii) it is highly efficient, and does not require any
bottom-up or heuristic post-processing step; (iii) it works
reliably on multi-orientation text; (iv) it is fast yet accurate,
and significantly outperforms those related approaches on
the standard ICDAR 2015 benchmark.
3. Methodology
We present details of the proposed single-shot text detec-
tor, which directly outputs word-level bounding boxes with-
out post-processing, except for a simple NMS. Our detector
is composed of three main parts: a convolutional compo-
nent, a text-specific component, and a box prediction com-
ponent. The convolutional and box prediction components
mainly inherit from SSD detector [17]. We propose the
text-specific component which contains two new modules:
a text attention module and a hierarchical inception module.
The convolutional architecture of the SSD is extended from
the 16-layer VGGNet [25], by replacing the fully-connected
Figure 3: Text attention module. It computes a text atten-
tion map from Aggregated Inception Features (AIFs). The
attention map indicates rough text regions and is further en-
coded into the AIFs. The attention module is trained by
using a pixel-wise binary mask of text.
(FC) layers with several convolutional layers [17]. The pro-
posed modules can be easily incorporated into the convo-
lutional component and box prediction component of the
SSD, resulting in an end-to-end trainable model, as shown
in Fig. 2. The two text-specific modules elegantly cus-
tomize the SSD framework towards accurate word detec-
tion. Compared to most recent methods [18, 28, 16], we
show experimentally that our particular designs provide a
more principled solution that generalizes better.
3.1. Text Attention Mechanism
Our attention module is able to automatically learn rough
spatial regions of text from the convolutional features. This
attention to text is then directly encoded back into the con-
volutional features, where text-related features are strongly
enhanced by reducing background interference in the con-
volutional maps, as shown in Fig. 3.
The attention module is built on the Aggregated Incep-
tion Feature (AIF) (described in Sect. 3.2). It generates
a pixel-wise probability heatmap which indicates the text
probability at each pixel location. This probability heatmap
is referred as the attention map which has an identical size
of an input image and will be downsampled for each predic-
tion layer. The attention module includes two 3× 3 convo-
lutional layers with pad 1, one deconvolution (upsampling
with bilinear operation) layer which connects the AIF to the
attention map. Then the attention map is generated by using
a softmax activation function on the de-convoluted features.
Specifically, given an input image of 512× 512, we get the
first-layer AIF features, FAIF1 ? R64×64×512. The atten-
tion map, ?+ ? R512×512, is computed as,
DAIF1 = deconv3×3(FAIF1), (1)
D?AIF1 = conv1×1(DAIF1), (2)
? = softmax(D?AIF1). (3)
where DAIF1 ? R512×512×512 is the de-convoluted fea-
ture maps, which are further projected to 2-channel maps,
D?AIF1 ? R512×512×2 using 1 × 1 kernels, followed by
a softmax function. Then the positive part of the softmax
maps, ?+, is the attention map, indicating pixel-wise possi-
bility of text. The attention map is further encoded into the
AIF by simply resizing it as with spatial size,
??+ = resize(?+), (4)
F?AIF1 = ??
+  FAIF1 . (5)
where ??+ ? R64×64 is the resized attention map, and 
indicates element-wise dot production across all channel of
the AIF maps. F?AIF1 is the resulted feature maps with en-
coded text regional attention. The AIFs with and without
text attention are shown in Fig. 3, where text information is
clearly presented when the attention is encoded.
The text attentional information is learned automatically
in the training process. We introduce an auxiliary loss
which provides a direct and detailed supervision of text via
a binary mask that indicates text or non-text at each pixel
location. A softmax function is used to optimize this atten-
tion map toward the provided text mask, explicitly encoding
strong text information into the attention module. Notice
that the proposed attention module is formulated in a uni-
fied framework which is trained end to end by allowing for
computing back-propagations through all layers.
The proposed attention module sets this work apart from
both previous pixel-wise and box-wise text detectors. It ele-
gantly handles the main limitations of both groups of meth-
ods, resulting in an efficient single-shot text detector that
produces accurate word-level text detection. Efficiency of
the proposed attention module is demonstrated in Fig. 4,
where detection results by a baseline model and a with-
attention model are presented. Obviously, the proposed at-
tention module improves the performance at three aspects:
(i) it reduces the number of false detections; (ii) it allows
the model to detect more ambiguous texts; (iii) it improves
the word-level detection accuracy.
3.2. Hierarchical Inception Module
In a CNN model, convolutional features in a lower layer
often focus on local image details, while the features in a
deeper layer generally capture more high-level abstracted
information. The SSD detector predicts object bounding
boxes at multi-layer convolutional maps, allowing it to lo-
calize multi-scale objects from a single-scale input. Texts
Figure 4: We compare detection results of the baseline model and the model with our text attention module (TAM), which
enables the detector with stronger capability for identifying extremely challenging text with a higher word-level accuracy.

often have large variations in scale with significantly dif-
ferent aspect ratios, making the single-scale text detection
highly challenging. In recent work [28], a layer-wise RNN
is incorporated into a convolutional layer, allowing the de-
tector to explore rich context information thought the whole
line. This RNN-based text detector is powerful to detect
near-horizontal text lines but is difficult to work reliably on
multi-orientation texts.
Inspired by the inception architecture of GoogleNet [26],
we propose a hierarchical inception module able to aggre-
gate stronger convolutional features. First, we develop a
similar inception module which is applied to each convo-
lutional layer, as shown in Fig. 5. This allows it to cap-
ture richer context information by using multi-scale recep-
tive fields. Second, we aggregate the inception features
from multiple layers and generate final Aggregated Incep-
tion Features (AIF).
Details of inception building block are described in Fig.
5. It is applied to those convolutional layers which are used
to predict word bounding boxes. The convolutional maps in
a layer are processed through four different convolutional
operations: 1× 1-conv, 3× 3-conv, 3× 3-pool with 1× 1-
conv, and 5 × 5-conv. The 5 × 5-conv is decomposed into
1 × 5 and 5 × 1 convolution layers. Dilated convolutions
[34], which support an exponential expansion of receptive
field without loss of resolution or coverage, are applied.
Each convolutional operation reduces the number of fea-
ture channels to 128. The final inception features are gen-
erated by simply concatenating four 128-channel features,
resulting in 512-channel inception features. By using mul-

Inception Module (HIM) model. The HIM allows the detec-
tor to handle extremely challenging text, and also improves
word-level detection accuracy.
tiple convolutional operations with channel concatenation,
the inception features have multi-scale receptive fields and
thus can focus on image content in a wide range of scales.
Motivated from HyperNet [5], we further enhance the
convolutional features by aggregating multi-layer inception
features, which generates final AIFs at three key convolu-
tional layers, as shown in Fig. 2. Each AIF is computed
by fusing the inception features of current layer with two
directly adjacent layers. Down-sampling and up-sampling
are applied to the lower layer and higher layer, respectively.
These sampling operations ensure same feature resolutions
for three inception features, which are combined together
using channel concatenation.
The proposed hierarchical inception module is related
to the skip architecture developed in [19], which combines
multi-layer convolutional features for handling multi-scale
objects. We propose a two-step aggregation approach by
leveraging efficient layer-wise inception module. This re-
sults in a stronger AIF, with richer local details encoded and
a more powerful multi-scale capability. Both improvements
are important for text task, allowing our model to identify
very small-scale text and work reliably on the multi-scale
text which often has a wider range of scales than the gen-
eral objects. Compared to layer-wise RNN method devel-
oped in [28], the AIF encodes more local detailed informa-
tion and generalizes better to multi-orientation text. The

effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical inception module
is demonstrated in Fig. 6.
3.3. Word Prediction Module
The proposed text-specific modules are directly incorpo-
rated into the SSD framework. It can be trained by simply
following the SSD, with slight modifications on the box pre-
diction part. As in [17], we use a softmax function for bi-
nary classification of text or non-text, and apply the smooth-
l1 loss for regressing 5 parameters for each word bounding
box, including a parameter for box orientation. Our model
predicts N word bounding boxes at each spatial location of
the inception or AIF maps. The predictions are computed
through all inception and AIF maps shown in Fig. 2. N
is the number of the pre-defined default word boxes, which
can be pre-computed. A default box is defined by its scale
and aspect ratio. Since different inception maps have var-
ious sizes of receptive fields, the scale of a default box is
varied over different inception or AIF maps. Its length is
measured by the number of pixels in the input image. To
better match the default boxes with ground truth ones, we
use three different scales for each layer, and the scales for
all inception and AIF layers are listed in Table 1.
Aspect ratios of a default box are set in a wide range (in
Table 1), due to the significant variances of them for text.
Same aspect ratios are used in all layers. In order to handle
multi-orientation text, a scale can be the width or height of
a default box. This results in 45 default boxes in total for
each layer, which allow the detector to handle large shape
variances of text. The center of a default box is identical
to the current spatial location of the inception/convolution
maps.
4. Experimental Results
Our methods are evaluated on three standard bench-
marks, the ICDAR 2013 [14], ICDAR 2015 [15] and
COCO-Text dataset [29]. The effectiveness of each pro-
posed component is investigated by producing exploration
studies. Full results are compared with the state-of-the-art
performance on the three benchmarks.
4.1. Datasets and Implementation Details
Datasets. The ICDAR 2013 [14] consists of 229 train-
ing images and 233 testing images, with word-level annota-
tions provided. It is the standard benchmark for evaluating
near-horizontal text detection. We use two standard eval-
uation protocols: the new ICDAR13 standard [15] and the
DetEval [14]. Our results were obtained by uploading the
predicted bounding boxes to the official evaluation system.
The ICDAR 2015 (Incidental Scene Text Challenge 4) [15]
was collected by using Google Glass and it has 1,500 im-
ages in total: 1,000 images for training and the remained
500 images for testing. This new benchmark was designed
for evaluating multi-orientation text detection. Word-level
annotations are provided and each word is labeled by the
coordinates of its four corners in a clockwise manner. This
dataset is more challenging and has images with arbitrary
orientations, motion blur, and low-resolution text. We eval-
uate our results based on the online evaluation system [15].
The COCO-Text [29] is the largest text detection dataset,
which has 63,686 annotated images in total: 43,686 for the
training and the rest 20,000 for testing.
Training datasets. Our training samples were collected
from the training sets of the ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2015.
We also added images harvested from Internet as the train-
ing data and manually labelled them with word level anno-
tation. We have 13, 090 training images in total. We did not
use the training data from the COCO-Text.
Implementation details. Our detection network is
trained end-to-end by using the mini-batch stochastic gra-
dient descent algorithm, where the batch size is set to 32,
with a momentum of 0.9. We initialize our model using the
pre-trained model in [17]. The learning rate is set to 0.001
and is decayed to its 110 after 15, 000 iterations. The model
is trained by fixing the first four convolutional layers, and
the training is stopped when the loss no longer decreases.
Data augmentation is used by following the SSD [17].
We take a similar strategy by randomly sampling a
patch from an image and set the minimum Jaccard
overlap with ground truth word bounding boxes to
{0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9}. The sampled patches are then re-
sized to 704 × 704 and are randomly mirrored with color
distortion. The NMS threshold and confidence threshold
are set to 0.3 and 0.7, respectively. Our methods were im-
plemented using Caffe [13], with TITAN X GPUs.
4.2. Exploration Study
We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed text at-
tentional module (TAM) and hierarchical inception mod-
ule (HIM) individually. We compare them with our base-
line model, which is extended from the SSD framework by
simply modifying the word prediction module (as described
in Sect. 3.3). Experimental results on the ICDAR 2013
are compared in Table 2, in the terms of precision, recall

and f-measure. First, we compare our baseline model with
original SSD trained on text data, without any modification
of the model. Our baseline model obtains significant per-
formance improvements and outperforms recent TextBoxes
[16], which is also extended from the SSD. Second, the
proposed TAM and HIM both achieve large improvements
in recall, indicating that the proposed text-specific modules
can increase model accuracy and improve its capability for
identifying challenging words, as shown in Fig. 4 and 6.
Third, by incorporating both TAM and HIM into a single
model, the final single-shot detector further improves the
performance in both recall and precision, obtaining a final
F-measure of 0.87. This suggests that both TAM and HIM
can compensate for each other in our model. Notice that
the performance on the ICDAR2013 is saturated, and the
improvement obtained by each component is significant.
4.3. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods
Qualitative results. Detection results on a number of
very challenging images are demonstrated in Fig. 7, where
our detector is able to correctly identify many extremely
challenging words, some of which are even difficult for hu-
man. It is important to point out that the word-level detec-
tion by our detector is particularly accurate, even for those
very small-scale words that are closed to each other.
On the ICDAR 2013. We compare our performance
against recently published results in Table 3. All our results
are reported on single-scale test images. On the ICDAR
2013 which is designed for near-horizontal text detection,
our detector achieves the state-of-the-art performance on
both evaluation standards. By using the ICDAR 2013 stan-
dard, which focuses on word-level evaluation, our method
obtains an F-measure of 0.87, outperforming all other meth-
ods compared, including recent FCRN [4], CTPN [28], and
TextBoxes [16]. By using the DetEval standard, our method
is comparable with the CTPN, and again has substantial im-
provements over the others. It has to point out that the DetE-
val standard allows for text-line level evaluation as well, and
is less strict than the ICDAR 2013 standard. Our method en-
courages a more accurate detection in word level, resulting
in better performance in the ICDAR 2013 standard.
In addition, we further evaluate our method for end-to-
end word spotting on the ICDAR 2013 by directly combin-
ing our detector with recent word recognition model pre-
sented in [6]. We obtain an accuracy of 0.83 on generic
case, which is comparable to recent results: 0.79 in [11]
and 0.85 in [4].
On the ICDAR 2015. The ability to work on multi-
orientation text is verified on the ICDAR 2015. Our method
obtains an F-measure of 0.77, which is a remarkable im-
provement over 0.61 achieved by CTPN [28]. This clearly
indicates that our method generalizes much better to multi-
orientation text than the CTPN. On the ICDAR 2015, our
method got the state-of-the-art performance in terms of re-
call, precision, and F-measure, surpassing recently pub-
lished results in [18] (0.71 F-measure) by a large margin.

In all implementations, our method obtains a higher re-
call than the others. This suggests that the proposed text-
specific modules enable our detector with stronger capabil-
ity for detecting extremely challenging text in a high word-
level accuracy, including the very small-scale, significantly-
slant or highly-ambiguous words, as shown in Fig. 7.
On the COCO-Text. We further evaluate our detector
on the COCO-Text [29], which is a large-scale text dataset.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance with an F-score
of 0.37, which improves recent state-of-the-art result [32]
slightly. This demonstrates strong generalization ability of
our method to work practically on large-scale images in the
unseen scenarios. Again, our method achieves a signifi-
cantly higher recall than all compared approaches.
Running time. We compare running time of various
methods on the ICDAR 2013 (in Table 3). Our detector
achieves running time of 0.13s/image using a single GPU,
which is slightly faster than CTPN using 0.14s/image. It is
sightly slower than TextBoxes [16], but has substantial per-
formance improvements. In addition, the TextBoxes was
not tested on the multi-orientation text. Besides, FCRN [4]
predicts word boxes at 0.07s/image, but it takes 1.2s/image
for post-processing the generated boxes. All recent CNN-
based approaches are compared on GPU time, which has
become the main stream with success of deep learning tech-
nologies. The fastest CPU based text detector is FASText
[1], using 0.15s/image. But its performance is significantly
lower than recent CNN-based approaches.
5. Conclusion
We have presented a fast yet accurate text detector that
predicts word-level bounding boxes in one shot. We pro-
posed a novel text attention mechanism which encodes
strong supervised information of text in training. This en-
ables the model to automatically learn a text attentional map
that implicitly identifies rough text regions in testing, allow-
ing it to work essentially in a coarse-to-fine manner. We
developed a hierarchical inception module that efficiently
aggregates multi-scale inception features. This further en-
hances convolutional features by encoding more local de-
tails and stronger context information. Both text-specific
developments result in a powerful text detector that works
reliably on the multi-scale and multi-orientation text. Our
method achieved new state-of-the-art results on the ICDAR
2013, ICDAR 2015 and COCO-Text benchmarks.
